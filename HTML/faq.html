        <div class="question">
            <button>
                <span>Do I need to take carbs right after a workout to restore my glycogen stores?</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
            </button>
            <p>Only under two circumstances. If you did intense cardio (cardio uses up significantly more glycogen than weight training does), and if you train more than once per day. Otherwise, there’s no need to “restore glycogen.” The human body is very good at maintaining glycogen stores and will restore them in less than 24 hours.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <button>
                <span>Everyone says fats are bad. Is that true?</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
            </button>
            <p>Fats are a necessary part of the diet. There are unhealthy forms of fat (mostly found in fried foods). However, the kinds of fat that you find in nuts, fish, and oils are healthy and should be consumed for healthy hormone production.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <button>
                <span>Which is More Productive: Less Weight/More Reps or More Weight/Less Reps?</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
            </button>
            <p>Both lifting methods offer their own distinct set of benefits. Less weight and more reps leads to better endurance and faster lean muscle growth. More weight and less reps causes larger muscles and overall higher strength. A combination of both techniques may be the most productive strategy.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <button>
                <span>How Long Before I Start Seeing Results?</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-down d-arrow"></i>
            </button>
            <p>This depends on your definition of “seeing.” You are likely to begin decreasing running times, increasing weight lifts, and maybe even shedding pounds all within the first month of beginning a fitness routine. However, if you are hoping to instantly attain a “beach bod,” you are only setting yourself up for disappointment. Physical changes in your body take many months to manifest themselves, so be patient and enjoy your healthy lifestyle day by day — the results will follow!</p>
